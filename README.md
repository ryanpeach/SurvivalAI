A Python based AI written for Minecraft.

Don't Starve implementation planned in future builds.

Python was chosen as it is the machine learning research language of choice.

## Goals

To create a human-like intelligence in Minecraft with just two fundamental goals:

1. Survive
2. Fourish

### Roadmap

In the spirit of these goals, here are some higher level design challenges:

1. Create an agent that can create shelter without a design
2. Create an agent that can explore and retrieve resources without direction

### Future Roadmap

Autonomous Building and Navigation
Goal Generation, Planning.
Emotive States for intrinsic motivation.
Understanding, Analogical and Case-Based Reasoning
Human Interactive Intelligence, Learning from Player input and Querys
Computational Creativity
Intelligent managing of Time and Resources.
Reinforcement learning.
